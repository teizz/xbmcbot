v0.8.0 - 15/06/2013

  Fixed:  Playing files from the list didn't always go case-sensitive first.
  Fixed:  Prevent play from playing the first file when no arguments are given
  Added:  Trace callback details are always printed when commands raise an exception
  Change: Changed directory change behaviour (case-sensitive first, then case-insensitive if first fails. Was first case-insensitive first)
